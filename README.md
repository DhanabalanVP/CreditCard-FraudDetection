# CreditCard-FraudDetection
The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. 

This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. We need to take care of the data imbalance while building the model and come up with the best model by trying various algorithms.
